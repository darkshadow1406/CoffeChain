                <h3>Jen Roberts | October 12, 2023</h3>
                <p> Born in Ethiopia as the granddaughter of a coffee farmer but raised mainly in Canada, Eight50 Coffee Founder Muna Mohammed had a profound experience when seeing coffee’s origins for the first time as an adult. 

“It was something that always fascinated me, but I didn’t quite understand it,” Mohammed recently told Daily Coffee News. “I knew we drank coffee — I knew it was culturally integrated into our heritage — but it wasn’t until I visited Ethiopia after graduating college that I got to understand the complexities of coffee.”
“I think COVID helped because it was a time where I was like, ‘It’s now or never — I’m going to launch this business,’” said Mohammed. “But I’m glad I took the time that I did [beforehand] because I started to really understand how the supply chain worked.”

Mohammed drew upon her marketing background to develop a name for the business that may begin to tell a story and also lead to more questions. The Eight50 name references the year (850 CE) in which coffee was first discovered in the wild in Ethiopia, according to popular legend. 

Said Mohammed, “I meet people all the time that think coffee comes from France or Italy.”  <br>
